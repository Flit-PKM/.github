# Flit-PKM

**Flutter through the web of your consciousness.**



Flit-PKM is a personal knowledge management ecosystem that transforms ephemeral auditory inputs—voice notes, conversations, lectures—into a dynamic, interconnected neural network of insights.

A butterfly lands lightly on the web of consciousness.  
It flits from thread to thread, stirring resonances.  
Hidden patterns emerge; distant memories connect.  
The web evolves—automatically, probabilistically—yet remains fully yours to reshape.

This is Flit-PKM: your second mind, automated yet editable, resonant yet private.

### Core Principles

- **Semantic Distillation**: Extract latent meanings from raw vocal streams for multidimensional similarity and emergent patterns.
- **Relational Synthesis**: Forge adaptive, probabilistic links in a graph-based ontology that evolves through inference.
- **Hierarchical Abstraction**: Layer from atomic fragments to synthesized overviews, enabling fractal navigation (temporal, thematic, contextual).
- **Cognitive Symbiosis**: Automation-first inferences with full user editability—no confirmation prompts, only intuitive post-hoc refinement.
- **Polymorphic Interfaces**: Seamless access across modalities, prioritizing discoverability and serendipity.

### Vision

Flit-PKM is built for individual, private use. It ingests voice, distills insights, weaves relations, and reveals correlations—all locally, with graceful degradation and reversible actions. No multi-user collaboration; exports planned for later stages.

### Repository Structure (Planned)

This organization will host modular repositories:

- `flit-core`: Backend logic (Python) – ingestion, distillation, graph synthesis.
- `flit-graph`: Knowledge graph persistence and inference.
- `flit-interface`: Polymorphic frontends (web, voice, mobile).
- `flit-docs`: Architecture, philosophy, and guides.

Development emphasizes simplicity, testability, maintainability, and technical debt prevention.

### Status

Early conceptual stage – architecture design in progress.

Contributions welcome once core prototypes stabilize. Issues and discussions open for philosophical or technical input.

Flutter onward.
